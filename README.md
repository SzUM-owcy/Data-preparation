# Plant Disease Recognition

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system for recognizing plant diseases.

## Dataset
We utilize the Plant Disease Recognition dataset available on Kaggle. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset?resource=download).

This dataset contains images of plants with three labels: "Healthy", "Powdery", and "Rust", indicating different plant conditions. In total, there are 1530 images split into train, test, and validation sets.
